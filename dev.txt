Client Scripts (g_form , getReference ) ----> it is used to custmozie forms using javascript 

g_form.getReference(fieldname , callback function);
g_form.getReference(fieldname);


*
If you're using getReference you will get ALL data for each record you "get" whether you need it or not.


*If you're using GlideAjax you only get what you need, 
because you will explicitly return the exact information you need and nothing else. **







*

you can use the getReference() to glide that particular record from client side and 
access the related record of that Glide Object, you can find the more details here: GlideForm - Client


client ---->getReference <----- glideObject (interface interactions)


getReference gets the record used in another reference field. For example you have the Caller ID (reference to the sys_user table) and with getReference, you will retrieve the User record and save this as a gliderecord into a variable. The main reason to use this function is to get more information from the referenced record.



Since this is used client side, it IS a call to the server which may impact performance if used too heavily.



Example:


var gr = g_form.getReference('caller_id');


alert('Caller Email is: ' + gr.email);



Since this is a server call, as already said above, I would recommend using the callback feature (new in Aspen):


var caller = g_form.getReference('caller_id', doAlert); // doAlert is our callback function



function doAlert(caller) { //reference is passed into callback as first arguments


alert('Caller Email is: ' + caller.email);


}
